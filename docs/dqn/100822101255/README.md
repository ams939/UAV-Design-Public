## DQN Experiment No. 100822101255
Date: 11.10.22
Notes:
- Using learning rate 0.001
- Using the new reward function (multiplication rather than subtraction of quality and penalty)
- 'extended' - Current problem with DQN is crashing after 30k iterations,
               ad-hoc solution was to just start it again but with the already
               trained model.
